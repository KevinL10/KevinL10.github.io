# RC4

Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) was designed by Ron Rivest and first published (or rather, [leaked](http://web.archive.org/web/20080404222417/http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1994/09/msg00304.html)) in 1994. It's considered a stream cipher, where the key generates a keystream that's combined with the plaintext (usually through XOR $\oplus$).

Generating the keystream is split into two steps:
- The Key-scheduling Algorithm (KSA) initializes a permutated array of all 256 bytes while mixing in the key
- The Pseudo-random Generation Algorithm (PRGA) uses the secret permutation to output one byte of the keystream at a time

## Key-scheduling Algorithm (KSA)

First, the array is initialized with the identity permutation:
```python
S = [i for i in range(256)]
```

Next, two pointers $i$ and $j$ permutate the array by swapping elements. The key is also mixed in during this step:
```python
j = 0
for i in range(256):
	j = (j + S[i] + key[i % len(key)]) % 256
	S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
```

Now, the array $S$ is permutated and kept secret.

## Pseudo-random Generation Algorithm

Similar to the KSA, the PRGA also uses two pointers (which should be kept secret). A series of operations outputs a byte of the keystream at a time while also modifying the state of the array:
- Each step, $i$ is incremented and $j$ increases by $S[i]$
- The values of $S[i]$ and $S[j]$ are swapped
- A third value taken from the sum of $S[i]$ and $S[j]$ is used as the keystream byte

Here's an implementation of the PRGA:

```python
i = 0
j = 0
while True:
	i = (i + 1) % 256
	j = (j + S[i]) % 256
	S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
	K = S[(S[i] + S[j]) % 256]
	print(K)
```

Finally, each keystream byte is XOR'ed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. Since XOR is its own inverse (that is, $A \oplus A = 0$), encryption and decryption follow the exact same process.

Putting everything together, a full implementation of RC4:
```python
key = b'Secret'
plaintext = b'Attack at dawn'

S = [i for i in range(256)]

j = 0
for i in range(256):
	j = (j + S[i] + key[i % len(key)]) % 256
	S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]

i = 0
j = 0
keystream = []
for i in range(len(plaintext)):
	i = (i + 1) % 256
	j = (j + S[i]) % 256
	S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
	K = S[(S[i] + S[j]) % 256]
	keystream.append(K)

ciphertext = [x ^ y for x, y in zip(plaintext, keystream)]
print(''.join([hex(c)[2:].zfill(2) for c in ciphertext]))
```

# Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir attack

Often, the key fed into the KSA is made up of a known IV and a secret key. If they're concatenated together, then the [Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir attack](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/egs/615/rc4_ksaproc.pdf) can recover the original key through weak IVs (given that we know the first byte of all keystreams).

![RC4 IV concatenated with key](/assets/img/rc4/concatenation.png)

The simplest weak IVs are made up of 3 bytes in the form $(A+3, N-1, X)$, where we know the first $A$ words of the secret key, $N$ is 256, and $X$ is any number. 

To find the next byte of the secret key, we first run $A+3$ iterations of the Key-scheduling Algorithm to permutate the array $S$. Notice that the first $A+3$ values of the entire key (IV concatenated with secret key) are known to us. 

I'll skip over the specifics of how the weak IV works; what's important is that in the end, the $i$ and $j$ pointers advance, swapping elements in such a way so that we can recover the next key byte through the equation: 

$$Key[i] \equiv (O - j - S[i]) \mod 256.$$ 

Here, $O$ is the first byte of the keystream, while $i$ and $j$ are the pointers from the KSA iterations. The equation above holds true with $5\%$ probability, which is easily distinguishable from a random byte. With 60 different values of $X$, we have over a $50\%$ chance of recovering the next byte of the key. 

In summary, we can recover the secret key with high probability if it's directly appended to a known weak IV and we know the first bytes of the keystreams.

Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir attack in code:
```python
# Implementation of RC4 encryption (only returns the keystream)
def encrypt(IV):
	key = IV + b'Vulnerable Secret Key'
	S = [i for i in range(256)]

	j = 0
	for i in range(256):
		j = (j + S[i] + key[i % len(key)]) % 256
		S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
	
	i = 0
	j = 0
	keystream = []

	for i in range(64):
		i = (i + 1) % 256
		j = (j + S[i]) % 256
		S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
		K = S[(S[i] + S[j]) % 256]
		keystream.append(K)

	return keystream

A = 0
curKey = b''

while True:
	results = []
	for i in range(256):
		# Construct weak IVS
		IV = bytes([A + 3, 255, i])
		keystream = encrypt(IV)
		knownKey = IV + curKey

		# Run KSA iterations with known key bytes
		S = [i for i in range(256)]
		j = 0
		for i in range(A + 3):
			j = (j + S[i] + knownKey[i % len(knownKey)]) % 256
			S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
		i += 1
		# Store the most likely next key byte
		results.append((keystream[0] - j - S[i]) % 256)

	# Next byte of the key should be the most common one
	nextByte = max(set(results), key = results.count)
	curKey += bytes([nextByte])
	print(f'Current Key: {curKey}')

	# Repeat for the next byte
	A += 1
