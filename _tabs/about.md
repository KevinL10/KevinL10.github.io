Hey! I'm Kevin Liu, a first year student in the [Faculty of Science](https://science.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). My interests include math and computer science, where I compete in competitive programming contests and regularly play [Capture The Flag](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) (CTF) competitions with [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/).
